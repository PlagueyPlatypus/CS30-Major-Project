# Proposal
Canvas Program

Put a description of what you're going to do here...
I plan on creating a whiteboard website, acting as an online canvas for both work and arts purposes. It would allow people to access a simple whiteboard with customizable (but limited) tools to create whatever you want. I would add a side activity to play, hopefully jogging ideas of what someone would like to draw. This would be both beneficial for people who need to brainstorm ideas and for people who wish to draw on a simple site.

## Needs To Have List

- A list of usable tools, and multiple presets for each tool

- A side activity, specfically a draw the image sidegame to help jog people's creative juices and showcase a bit more of my knowledge of CS30

## Nice to Have List

- Would be great to have a gradiant scale for color selection, allowing much more diversity

- A second sidegame, completely just a game to help people relax, (i.e. like a flow game, or a fill in the space)
